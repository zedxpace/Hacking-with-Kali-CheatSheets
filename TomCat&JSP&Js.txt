: Tom-Cat :

Tomcat is an application server from the Apache Software Foundation that executes Java servlets and renders Web pages that include Java Server Page coding. Described as a "reference implementation" of the Java Servlet and the Java Server Page specifications, Tomcat is the result of an open collaboration of developers and is available from the Apache Web site in both binary and source versions. Tomcat can be used as either a standalone product with its own internal Web server or together with other Web servers

- java_servelet : A Java servlet is a Java software component that extends the capabilities of a server. Although servlets can respond to any types of requests, they most commonly implement web containers for hosting web applications on web servers and thus qualify as a server-side servlet web API.

- web_container : It is the component of a web server that interacts with Java servlets. A web container handles requests to servlets, JavaServer Pages (JSP) files, and other types of files that include server-side code

- JavaServer Pages : JavaServer Pages (JSP) is a technology that helps software developers create dynamically generated web pages based on HTML, XML, or other document types. Released in 1999 by Sun Microsystems, JSP is similar to PHP and ASP, but it uses the Java programming language.
