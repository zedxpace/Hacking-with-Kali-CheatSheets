: Information Gathering :

: Considering in same ip range :
: Scanning for Ip-Address:
netdiscover -r [ip]			              
// -r range /8/16/24 

: Port scanning :

nmap -v -P 0-65535 -A [ip] -oA [named-file]   	      //in this all ports and all info will be scanned and it is time consuming
// -v View Process Onscreen
// -P Port Number to be scanned
// -A Scan other info also
// -oA output in all format 


nmap -v -T5 -p 0-65535 -A [ip] -oA [named-file]	     //as due to -T5 its is faster we should be sured that network is reliable      
// -v View Process Onscreen
// -T time limit 
// -P Port Number to be scanned
// -A Scan other info also
// -oA output in all format
